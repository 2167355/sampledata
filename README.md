# Nexosis API - Sample Data
### Sample datasets for use against the Nexosis Machine Learning API

The included CSV files are all real-world data sets that are usable with the Nexosis API.

Locations A through C and Products A through C are specifically vetted for forecasting.

Location D is vetted for impact analysis, with an impact date range of 2015-10-11 through 2015-12-31.

The simplest way to get these data sets into your account is with a [Url import](http://docs.nexosis.com/guides/importingdata).  For the Url parameter, simply provide the 'raw' Github link to the file (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexosis/sampledata/master/LocationC.csv)
